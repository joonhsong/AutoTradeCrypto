'''
This code is solely designed by Joon Song, myself. I have tried to
create code that analyzes which crypto currency has the most upward
movement. If it detects a sudden upward movement, it buys the coin and 
sells at given percentage return. This code automatically chooses the currency
with most upward movement and tries to make profit from the movement. 
However, sometimes the price falls after sudden increase, so I have created counter
so that if the price doesn't make profit, it sells before too much loss.
