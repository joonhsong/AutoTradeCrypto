# Auto CryptoTrader

This repository focuses on exploring multiple algorithms, machine learning models and strategies that can be used in forecasting
time series data, which can be applied to stock or crypto currency market predictions.
Currently, as of July 2023, the main focus is to apply Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Informer (based on transformer)
to predict crypto currency price or return using Upbit API, in which Upbit is the largest coin exchange market in South Korea in trading volume. 
In addition to exploring existing algorithms and models, I have also tried to create trading strategy of my own, and testing it on the market.
