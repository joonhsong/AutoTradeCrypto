# Trading Bot for Upbit

## Purpose
This repository focuses on exploring multiple algorithms, machine learning models and strategies that can be used in forecasting
time series data, which can be applied to stock or crypto currency market predictions.
Currently, the main focus is to apply Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Informer (based on transformer)
to predict crypto currency price or return using Upbit API, in which Upbit is the largest coin exchange market in South Korea in trading volume. 

## Focus
Many sources from the Internet describe how to use LSTM model to predict stock/crypto price. However, transformer has replaced many models including
LSTM and RNN, which makes using LSTM feel outdated. Consequently, I will be researching more on how to apply transformer, informer particularly, on
predicting the market. I want to focus on exploring informer suggested in the paper "Informer: Beyond Efficient Transformer for Long Sequence Time-Series Forecasting", as it 
suggests improvements on original transformer model and apply it to time series data for forecasting.
In addition to exploring existing algorithms and models, I have also tried to create trading strategy of my own, and testing it on the market.
