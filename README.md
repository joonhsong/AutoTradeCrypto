# Auto CryptoTrader

This repository focuses on exploring multiple algorithms, machine learning models and strategies that can be used in forecasting
time series data, which can be used in stock or crypto currency market predictions.
Currently, as of July 2023, the main focus is to apply Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Informer (based on transformer)
to predict crypto currency price or return using Upbit API, which is the largest coin exchange market in South Korea in trading volume. 
I have also tried to create algorithm of my own, and testing it on the market.
