# Auto CryptoTrader

This repository focuses on exploring multiple algorithms and strategies that can be used in trading crypto currency.
Right now, the main focus is on using volatility breakout strategy and using Long Short Term Memory model. My code mainly 
uses Python libraries and Upbit API, which is the largest Cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea.
